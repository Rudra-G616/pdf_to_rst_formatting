PREFACE
The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) is one of the Indian Institutes of Technology in the
country, set up with the objective of conducting research, imparting education, and training in vari-
ous fields of Science and Technology. The Institute is now recognized as a leader in science and en-
gineering education worldwide. It has established a firm foundation for education and research with
a vision to be the fountainhead of new ideas and innovations in technology and science. The mission
of IIT Bombay is to create an ambiance in which new ideas, research and scholarship flourish and
from which the leaders and innovators of tomorrow emerge.
IIT Bombay on an average annually admits more than 1000 candidates for the undergraduate pro-
grammes (B.Tech./ Dual Degree and B.S.) through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), more than
30 candidates for B.Des. Programme through the Undergraduate Common Entrance Exam for Design
(UCEED), around 300 candidates for the M.Sc. and the M.Sc. Ph.D. Dual Degree programmes, more
than 1000 candidates for postgraduate programmes and around 300 candidates for Ph.D. pro-
grammes. IIT Bombay follows a credit-based semester system. There are two semesters in an aca-
demic year (Autumn: July- Nov; and Spring: January-April) during which all courses specified for var-
ious degree programmes are offered. There is one additional term during summer, called the Sum-
mer Term, for summer courses. Students are required to meet specified academic requirements each
semester.
This booklet provides comprehensive information on the Rules and Regulations for B.Tech., Dual De-
gree, B.S. and B.Des. Programmes.
IIT Bombay gives freedom to its various academic units to tailor their academic programmes as per
their specific needs, within the frame work of the Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate
from time to time. Keeping in view the new technical developments and to allow students some
freedom to explore topics of their interest, IIT Bombay revised its Undergraduate Programmes cur-
riculum (w.e.f. the Academic Year 2013). The revised curriculum, provides additional opportunities
and flexibility for students to optimize their learning experience. This needs continuous and meticu-
lous planning of the academic profile on the part of each student to fully utilize the opportunities.
The students, and parents/ guardians, are therefore, advised in their own interest to get fully familiar
with the Academic system of the Institute. Student’s attention is brought particularly to the assess-
ment procedures and the specific rules governing the grading system, academic performance re-
quirements etc.
IIT Bombay offers its students best opportunities that are needed to create outstanding scientists
and engineers. We hope that you will strive hard to utilize the resources available to fully develop
your potential as an engineer/ scientist/ designer /economist/ social scientist.
We wish all our students a very bright future and a successful career.

1. INTRODUCTION
The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes consist of courses in basic sciences, humanities and social
sciences, engineering and technology and other related topics. The sequence of studies broadly consists
of three phases.
The first phase is an intense study of sciences, mathematics and humanities for deeper understanding
of concepts than what was done in school.
The second phase is the study of engineering sciences and technical arts (such as workshop, engineering
graphics, etc.). This study imparts broad based knowledge in general engineering, and engineering meth-
odologies, and enables the students to appreciate the links between science and engineering. This phase
is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with the first phase.
In the third phase, the students are exposed to subjects in their chosen areas of study, designed to train
them in the methodologies of analysis of problems and synthesis of solutions. The courses cover the
principles governing systems and processes, and develop the ability for physical and analytical modeling,
design and development. They are also introduced to engineering practices through laboratory courses,
projects, etc., and these vary from discipline to discipline.
In parallel with the third phase, students can strive to broaden their perspectives through atleast two
open Institute electives where they can take courses drawn from across the Institute.
B.S. programme students, in addition, work independently on a project in their last two semesters.
Dual Degree students do additional courses to get in-depth knowledge in their chosen disciplines, often
with specializations. In addition, they work on a research and development project during their final year.
At various stages of the programme, students are initiated into research methodologies, reading and
interpreting research papers, use of engineering and scientific equipments/ instruments, modern com-
putational techniques, writing technical and scientific reports and effective communication.
Apart from the minimum credit requirements for the award of the degree, opportunities exist for sup-
plementing the learning experience by crediting additional courses, in diverse areas. These additional
credits, when they are in focused areas, can earn the students’ credentials like Minor/ Honours.
The requirements for degree programmes run by the Institute are broadly classified as:
a) Institute Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other
requirements).
b) Departmental Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and
other requirements).
The curriculum for various programmes are available on the Institute website: www.iitb.ac.in
1.1 Organizational Structure for Academic Administration
The academic programmes of the Institute are governed by Rules and Regulations approved by the Sen-
ate from time to time. The Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic matters of
the Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairperson (Director of The Institute) are final in regard to all
academic issues. A definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic activities, through an
Academic Calendar issued at the beginning of each academic year.
7
Move to Index

--- Page 8 ---
The Senate continuously assesses the academic programmes and makes appropriate revisions/ modifi-
cations/ improvements as and when required through two Institute level Senate sub-committees: The
Undergraduate Programmes Committee (UGPC) for undergraduate programmes and a Post- Graduate
Programmes Committee (PGPC) for post-graduate programmes. The Dean of Academic Programmes
(Dean, AP) and the Associate Dean of Academic Programmes (Associate Dean, AP) are the Conveners
& Co-conveners respectively of these committees.
Similarly, the performance and evaluation related issues are monitored by the Senate through two Insti-
tute level committees: Undergraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (UGAPEC) and
Postgraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (PGAPEC). Conveners for these committees
are designated from among Senate members. These four committees make recommendations to the
Senate and in turn seek/ receive opinions/ recommendations, when required, from the two Department
level committees in each department, the Department Undergraduate Committee (DUGC) and the De-
partment Postgraduate Committee (DPGC). The DUGCs and DPGCs handle all academic matters, related
to both academic programmes as well as performance of individual student. The Head of the Department
is the convener of both these departmental committees. The Senate as well as its sub-committees also
have student representatives. Administrative backup for all academic matters is provided by the Aca-
demic Office, with a Joint/ Deputy Registrar (Academic) as in-charge.
On joining the Institute, each student is assigned a Faculty Adviser from his/her Department. Students
must consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses
they may take in various semesters/ summer terms. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete
their courses of study for the required degree in a timely manner, while maintaining good academic
performance.
All academic issues connected with the B.Tech., Dual degree, B.S. and B.Des. programmes are handled
by DUGC, UGAPEC and UGPC. If on any academic matter a student would like to approach this adminis-
trative structure, it is always through the DUGC with advice and recommendations from her /his Faculty
Adviser.

1.2 Academic Calendar
The academic activities of the Institute are regulated by the Academic Calendar approved by the Senate,
and released at the beginning of each academic year. It is mandatory for students / faculty to strictly
adhere to the academic calendar for completion of academic activities. The Academic Calendar can be
seen on the Academic Office website of the Institute: (http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/toacadcal-
ender.jsp)
2 CURRICULUM / PROGRAMME OF STUDY
2.1 Curriculum
Every Department has a prescribed course structure which, is known as the Curriculum. It prescribes the
courses, labs and other requirements for award of the degree and sets out the nominal sequence se-
mester-wise. It also gives the syllabus and a list of texts and reference books for each course. The Curric-
ulum details are updated every semester and are made available at the Institute website.
2.2 Semester – Autumn, Spring, Summer
The Institute follows a credit-based semester system. There are two regular semesters in a year. The
semester that begins in July (July to Nov.) is known as the Autumn Semester or Semester 1 and the
semester that begins in January (Jan. to April/May) is known as the Spring Semester or Semester 2. Dur-
ing the summer vacation, i.e., (May-June), a few courses are offered as part of Summer Term (refer Sec.
4.8). These courses can be taken by students as per summer term guidelines.
2.3 Course Credit Structure
In general, a certain quantum of academic work measured in terms of credits is laid down as the require-
ment for a particular degree. A student earns credits by satisfactorily clearing courses/ other academic
activities every semester. The credits associated with a course/ other academic activity are dependent
on the number of hours of work expected to be put in by the student per week.
2.3.1 Theory and Laboratory Courses
Courses are broadly classified as Theory Courses and Laboratory Courses. Theory courses consist of lec-
ture (L) and tutorial (T) hours, but may have attached practical (P) hours in special cases. Laboratory
courses consist of practical hours, but may have attached tutorial hours in special cases. Credit (C) for a
course is obtained by multiplying the number of hours of instruction per week in that course, by two (2)
for lecture and tutorial hours, and by one (1) for laboratory hours i.e. C = 2xL + 2xT + P. A student is
expected to spend, on average, one hour every week outside class for every lecture/ tutorial held that
week. Two examples of credit calculation are shown below:
Theory Courses Laboratory Courses
L T P C L T P C
2 1 0 6 0 1 3 5
9
Move to Index

--- Page 10 ---
In the Courses of Study, if a theory course is shown as, say, CE304 Soil Mechanics II: 2 1 0 6, it means
that CE304 is the course code, Soil Mechanics II is the course title and 2 1 0 6 corresponds to L T P C
respectively.
Other academic activities consist of a Seminar, Projects, which carry credits and NSO/ NSS/ NCC, in which
only a pass (PP) or no-pass (NP) grades are awarded.
2.3.2 Course Equivalence (Ref: 251st Senate Meeting):
Addition of course equivalence for core courses will be permitted on approval of DUGC of respective
Academic Units.
2.3.3 Seminars
Some departments prescribe a Seminar as a requirement for B.Tech./ B.S./ B.Des. or the Dual Degree. A
Seminar is a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected to do an in-
depth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and understand
different aspects of the problem. Finally, the results from literature must be summarized in a written
report and presented before a designated committee of faculty members. Seminars typically carry 3
credits.
2.3.4 Projects
2.3.4.1 B.Tech. Projects (BTP - I and BTP – II)
Some departments prescribe Project as a requirement for the B.Tech. degree, or as a requirement for
Honours (refer Sec.2.5.2), wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student, in the sixth se-
mester or later, is required to do innovative work with the application of knowledge gained from courses
in the earlier years. The student is expected to do a survey of literature in the subject, work out a project
plan and carry it out through design, analysis, experimentation etc. These projects (BTPs) may be offered
as a single unit of 12 credits (BTP) or as 6 credits of BTP-I followed by BTP-II of 6 credits or 12 credits.
(Ref: 241st Senate Meeting)
Even when it is not prescribed as a minimum requirement for the degree or when not being interested
in Honours, a student can opt to do a BTP as additional learning, if s/he can find suitable supervisor (s)
to guide her/him.
2.3.4.2 B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)
Some departments prescribe a B.S. Project as a requirement for the B.S. degree. Such a project
is carried out under the guidelines of a faculty member and may carry 6 or more credits as prescribed by
the department.
2.3.4.3 Dual Degree Project (DDP)
The Dual Degree Project is a mandatory requirement of the Dual Degree Programmes. The project con-
sists of two stages, spread over fourteen months, normally starting from the summer after the eighth
semester and ending with the summer after the tenth semester. These are essentially research and de-
velopment projects, where a student trains under the guidance of supervisor/ s, in-depth analysis of an
engineering problem and attempts synthesis of a solution. Literature survey, problem analysis and prob-
lem definition, extensive experimental/ modeling/ computational work and analysis of results typically
form various components of the project work. A DDP (B.Tech.-M.Tech.) carries a total of 72 credits.
10
Move to Index

--- Page 11 ---
2.3.4 Non-Credit Requirements
2.3.4.1 NCC / NSO / NSS
One of the three activities, National Cadet Corps (NCC) or National Sports Organization (NSO) or Na-
tional Service Scheme (NSS) is a mandatory requirement for all students for the award of a degree.
These are normally conducted during evenings of week days and are designed to build character and to
sensitize the students to social/ national issues. These activities carry no credits and are evaluated as
Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP).
2.4 Minimum Credit Requirements and Planning of Individual Academic Programme (Ref: 233rd
Senate Meeting)
Depending on the discipline, the minimum credits required for the award of a B.Tech. / B.S. / B.Des.
degree are between 266 and 282 (till 2021 batch), though the department component can be differently
designed by the departments.
This is nominally divided into Basic Sciences (60 to 62), Engineering Sciences & skills (30), HSS Electives
(12), Institute Electives (12), Departmental courses (152 to 168).
The "B.Tech. + M.Tech. Dual Degree programme" should have all of the following components over and
above the corresponding basic B.Tech. curriculum:
a) B.Tech Honours credit a minimum of 24 credits that can comprise of either only courses or a
combination of courses and a Project. The Project duration can be of two semesters with a
maximum of 18 credits.
b) 24 credits consisting of four masters level courses.
c) 72 credits of a masters' thesis spread over 14 months (e.g. summer between eighth and ninth
semester, plus ninth and tenth semesters). The credits are distributed semester-wise as shown
in the Courses of Study bulletin for each department. Courses generally progress in sequences,
building competencies and their positioning indicates certain academic maturity on the part of
the students. Some courses do, in addition, specify passing in courses offered earlier in the pro-
grammes as pre-requisites. Students are expected to follow the semester-wise schedule of
courses given in the Courses of Study bulletin; they do, however, have freedom to follow alter-
native schedules to optimize their academic profile with additional courses, keeping the require-
ments for each course in mind. For students who may have dropped mandatory courses, such
rescheduling may even become necessary. Such departures from suggested schedules need to
be done very carefully, and always with approval of the Faculty Adviser.
d) In addition to the DD requirements, if a student completes 24.0 credits towards the honors of
the parent department, then he/ she will be considered for award of B. Tech./ B.S. with honors
of the parent department subject to the recommendation of DUGC of the parent department
(2021 batch onwards).
2.5 Opportunities for Additional Learning: MINOR, HONOURS, ETC.:
The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes recognize the fact that students’ aspirations and the de-
mands of the work place, have become highly diverse. Every student has specific abilities, interests and
career goals.
11
Move to Index

--- Page 12 ---
Each programme prescribes the minimum credits and courses that qualify a candidate for the award of
the Degree in a particular discipline. The total credits for the B.Tech. Programme, for example, vary be-
tween 266-282 (till 2021 batch) depending on the discipline, as mentioned earlier. This approximately
converts itself into about four theory courses and one or two laboratory courses or other activities like
seminar, project, etc., every semester.
The curriculum is designed to permit B.Tech., B.S. and B.Des. students, who are not identified as aca-
demically weak, to optionally take additional courses. The freedom to take about six credits every se-
mester after the first year, permits a student to satisfy her/his interests / abilities and aspirations.
It is expected that all students with reasonably good academic standing, utilize this surplus time for en-
hancing their academic learning experience, though the initiative is left entirely to them. They can use it
to credit an assortment of courses/projects anywhere in the Institute, (subject to requirements of each
of these courses being met), to gain a wide exposure. These additional academic accomplishments will
find a separate mention in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4). They can also credit courses in specific areas
which can qualify as a minor/ honours. They may alternatively devote part or all of the additional time
for extra- curricular activities (including social work) if they so desire, and gain hands-on administrative/
managerial/ aesthetic skills or sensitivity towards social issues.
Since seats available in such additional courses are often limited and the competition severe, students
aspiring to do these additional courses have to maintain high academic standing to register in these
courses.
2.5.1 Minor
Minor is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he does 30 credits worth of additional courses
in a discipline other than her/his major discipline of B.Tech. degree. All academic units in the Institute
offer minors in their disciplines, and will prescribe a specific set of courses and/or projects necessary for
earning a minor in that discipline.
A student must pre-register for a minor course which is finally allotted on the basis of highest CPI. S/he
accumulates credits by registering for the required courses, and if the requirements for a particular mi-
nor are met within the prescribed minimum time limit for the programme, the minor will be awarded.
This will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx with Minor in yyy.”
This will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken.
Since the number of seats available for each of the courses are often limited, one has to compete for a
place in every course. If 30 credits are not completed for Minor then Minor will not be awarded. The
individual course credits earned, however, will be reflected in the transcript.
For the award of the minor, all requirements towards the basic degree and the minor have to be com-
pleted within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for.
The Senate in its 224th meeting approved the proposal of allowing Dual Degree students to undertake
minor courses. These rules were further modified in the 236th meeting of the Senate.
DD students of category I and II can register for minor courses from 2nd year onwards. These students
are allowed to take additional courses (within permissible credit limit) in their 9th and 10th Semesters,
if needed to complete the minor requirement. (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting)
12
Move to Index

--- Page 13 ---
2.5.2 Honours
Honours is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he opts for the extra 24 credits needed for
this in her/his own discipline. The concerned department specifies the set of courses for earning Honours.
Honours is not indicative of class.
Students can accumulate credits by registering for Honours courses prescribed by the department. On
successful accumulation of 24 credits at the end of the programme, this will be mentioned in the Degree
Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with Honours.” This will also be reflected in the transcript,
along with the list of courses taken.
For the award of the honours to B.Tech. students, all requirements towards the basic degree and the
honours have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for.
Dual degrees of B.Tech. and M.Tech. intrinsically demand a deeper expertise in the major discipline of
the student, and therefore Dual Degree students are required to complete the requirements for Honours,
as prescribed by the department. The requirements for Honours for a Dual Degree student may be dif-
ferent from those prescribed for a B.Tech. student. This requirement is over and above the basic require-
ments for the B.Tech. degrees as prescribed by each department. The total credit requirement (till 2021
batch) is therefore 266-282 (B.Tech.) + 24 (Honours) + 72 (Project) + 24 (Masters courses).
2.5.3 More than one minor for students (Ref: 259th Senate Meeting)
Students can opt for earning additional minor/s (i.e. an Honour and a minor, OR if time table permits,
two or more minors). Students should discuss this with their faculty advisers since completing more than
one minor would involve significant overload.
3. ROLE OF THE FACULTY ADVISER
On joining the Institute, a student or a group of students is/are assigned to a Faculty Adviser. The stu-
dents are expected to consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance
and the courses they may take in various semesters. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete
their courses of study for the required degree. For effective utilization of the opportunities for additional
academic accomplishments, the planning of an individual’s academic journey needs careful considera-
tion, and hence constant consultation with the Faculty Advisers are imperative. The Faculty Adviser is
the person whom the parents/ guardians should contact for performance related issues of their wards.
The role of the Faculty Adviser is outlined below:
a) Guide the students about the rules and regulations governing the courses of study.
b) Advise the students to register for courses as per the curriculum and their academic standing.
c) Approve the registration of the students.
d) Pay special attention to weak students and carefully monitor the performance of students rec-
ommended for the slow track option.
e) Advice students on Course Adjustment / Drop during the Semester within the stipulated time
frame given in the Academic calendar.
13
Move to Index

--- Page 14 ---
f) Advice students seeking a semester drop about rules and regulations laid down for this purpose
and recommend these cases to the UGAPEC through the DUGC, for consideration.
g) Consider and recommend to the DUGC, applications for course/ credit requirements for the stu-
dents for exchange programmes. In addition, the faculty adviser converts the grades from the
foreign institute to IIT Bombay as per senate approved rules.
h) To ensure that students are not permitted to re-register for courses, which they have already
passed.
i) Inform students that grades will not be awarded for any academic activity (course/ Lab./ semi-
nar/ project/ non-credit requirement etc.) without approved registration.
j) Strictly warn students that if s/he fails to register during any semester without prior approval,
his/her studentship is liable to be cancelled.
4. REGISTRATION
Registration at the beginning of each semester, as per the prescribed dates announced in the Academic
Calendar, is mandatory for every student till s/he completes her/ his programme. If a student does not
register in a particular semester without prior permission of the UGAPEC, her/his studentship is liable to
be cancelled. Students are not permitted to re-register for course/(s), which they have already passed.
All students’ registration has to be approved by his/ her faculty Adviser. Some courses may also require
instructor consent.
4.1 Semester-Wise registration
On joining the Institute, each student is assigned to a Faculty Adviser or an Advisory group (refer Sec.3).
The student can register for courses s/he intends to take during a given semester or summer term on
the basis of the programme for each discipline as given in the Curriculum and as per the advice given by
his/her Faculty Adviser. The Faculty Adviser is expected to discuss with the student his/her academic
performance during the previous semester and then decide the number and nature of the courses for
which s/he can register during the semester within the framework of the guidelines as approved by the
Senate. The Faculty Adviser may advise the student to drop one or more courses/ activities based on
his/her academic performance (refer Sec. 5.1). In fact, the Faculty Adviser may even advise a reduced
load programme over several semesters for students with poor performance at the end of the first se-
mester/ year.
4.2 Procedure for Registrations
The Institute has an online registration system and the registration is normally done on the first two days
of each semester. The registration schedule is announced in the Academic Calendar. In all circumstances,
registration must be completed on or before the prescribed last date for registration. Students having
outstanding dues to the Institute or a hostel shall not be permitted to register.
4.2.1 Online Registration
The online registration process involves filling up of an online Course Registration Form (CRF) stating the
courses and project / seminar etc., that the student proposes to complete during that semester as per
the prescribed curriculum. This should be done in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, who finally ap-
proves the registration as per permissible load (refer Sec. 5.2). Grades will not be awarded for any
14

--- Page 15 ---
academic activity (course/ Lab./ seminar/ project/ non-credit requirement etc.) without approved regis-
tration.
4.2.2 Late Registration
Only for valid reasons, late registration may be permitted till the date specified in the Academic Calendar,
on payment of a late registration fee.
4.2.3 Registration for the first two semesters (except B.Des.)
In each of the first two semesters, courses common to all branches are generally offered. A student is
normally required to register for all the courses listed in the curriculum for these two semesters. Stu-
dents, who are identified as academically weak at the end of first semester, may be prescribed a reduced
load (refer Sec. 10).
4.2.4 Registration for third and subsequent semesters
The prescribed credits per semester is given in the course bulletin of the respective academic units. From
the third semester onwards, registration is dependent on the academic standing of the student. A stu-
dent with an academic standing of Category I, II, III and IV may register for additional courses over and
above the prescribed credits in the course bulletin with the approval of Faculty Adviser subject to Section
5.2.
4.3 Registration for Institute Elective Courses:
An Institute Elective course can be any credit course across the Institute provided that:
a) It should not be from the Academic Unit in which the student is registered.
b) It should not be ‘Core’ or ‘Department Elective’ course in the curriculum on the programme in
which the student is registered.
An Institute Elective course should be registered in consultation of Faculty Advisor.
4. 4 Registration for Non-credit courses (NCC/ NSO / NSS)
Non-credit requirements are assessed as Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP) subject to the fulfillment of the mini-
mum requirements of these activities and a minimum of 80% attendance. One of NCC, NSO or NSS, is a
mandatory requirement for the award of degree. Students are expected to complete these requirements
during the first year (first two semesters). Formal registration for any one of these activities must be
done along with other courses, at the beginning in the first two semesters. The choice of the activity will
be done on the basis of the aptitude of the student for any one of these activities and will be decided by
a committee constituted for the purpose. Once registered for one of these activities, no change will be
permitted at a later stage.
In addition to the above mandatory requirements, the students are permitted to take NSS/NSO/NCC in
subsequent years too, if they have special interest. This will be mentioned in the transcript (refer
Sec.6.8.4)
4.5 Registration for Projects
4.5.1 Registration for B.Tech. Projects (BTPs):
Registration for B.Tech. Projects (BTPs) as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other
course. The details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc. are specified by the concerned depart-
ment before the commencement of the semester.
15

b) Each Dual Degree student should have a member of the faculty as a supervisor. In addition, Co-
supervisor/(s) from the same Department/ other Department / IDP Group/Centre / School may
be co-opted by the supervisor with the approval of the DUGC. If the supervisor is not from the
same department as the student, a co-supervisor from the Department is necessary.
c) Whenever a supervisor leaves the Institute permanently/ temporarily, the DUGC shall make al-
ternative arrangements for guidance during the supervisor’s absence.
Requirements for the DDP and the evaluation procedures are given in (refer Sec. 6.4.2)
4.5.3 Registration for B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)
Registration for B.S. Projects as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other course. The
details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc. are specified by the concerned department before
the commencement of the semester.
4.6 Course Adjustment/ Dropping of courses
a) The Academic Calendar sets a date, typically one week after the commencement of the semes-
ter, for Course Adjustment. On or before this date, a student is permitted to make adjustments
in her/his academic load by addition or deletion of one or more courses, projects etc., provided
the total credits do not exceed the bounds (refer Sec. 5.2). Course adjustment has to be done in
consultation with the Faculty Adviser.
b) If in the second or any of the subsequent semesters, a student finds her/his academic load too
heavy, s/he may drop some courses in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, provided the min-
imum credit requirements (18 credits) are fulfilled. The last date for such drops is typically 20-
30 days after the end of the mid-semester examination, and is set in the Academic Calendar. It
16
Move to Index

--- Page 17 ---
is expected that the results of the mid-semester examination will be known within seven days
of the end of the examination.
4.7 Dropping of a Semester:
a) A student may opt/be advised to drop an entire semester, with prior approval of DUGC/UGAPEC
due to the following reasons:
i. During a registered semester, if a student finds that s/he is unable to cope up with the stud-
ies and/or does not have sufficient exposure to most of the courses registered in that se-
mester due to severe health problem or some other valid reasons beyond her/his control,
s/he can opt to drop the entire semester, in consultation with the Faculty Adviser and with
permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC.
ii. A student may seek a semester drop, due to severe personal health problem, unavoidable
family commitments or other valid reasons beyond her/his control, in consultation with the
Faculty Adviser and with permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC, prior to the commencement
of the semester itself.
b) In all cases of severe health problems, medical certificate issued by IIT Hospital is essential. If
however, the medical certificate is issued by other hospitals/private practitioners, the certifi-
cates should be duly authenticated by the CMO, IIT Hospital. In all other cases, requests for
dropping the semester should be accompanied by supporting documents as required.
c) A student will be not permitted to drop a semester after the award of DX/ II grade/(s) and/ or
semester end examination.
d) Such breaks from studies is typically not permitted for a continuous period in excess of one year.
e) Not registering for any semester before the last date for registration without prior approval of
the UGAPEC may result in the UGAPEC recommending dropping that semester. (Ref: 240th Sen-
ate meeting)
f) Hostel accommodation and other institutional facilities will not be extended in any semester for
which the student has not registered.
4.8 Registration for Additional Courses (Minor, Honours etc.): (Ref.- 236th Senate Meeting)
Any student may register for minor or Honours courses subject to satisfying the pre-requisites for the
respective courses. The number of students permitted for Minor courses is to be specified before the
registration date by the department, and the allocation is done on the basis of CPI. Students are permit-
ted to register for Minor courses only during the pre- registration period .
Note that there is no specific registration for Honours Courses. One accumulates the required credits
during the course of the programme and the additional credential is awarded if the criteria set for them
are met when the student graduates.
In any semester, a student must register for at least one course component that is specified as the min-
imum requirement of the degree. Moreover, a student cannot overstay in the programme once the min-
imum requirements prescribed for the basic degree are completed.
17

--- Page 18 ---
4.9 Summer term Course Registration:
Running of courses in summer term and registration of students to these courses must follow the guide-
lines mentioned below:
a) The course instructor/(s) should be willing to offer the course. The DUGC should recommend
offering of such a summer course for consideration and approval of the Dean of
Academic Programmes. The course is offered on approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes.
b) The course should be offered with adequate rigor and in the same manner as a regular semester
course is offered. The registration, examination and assessment, course duration and grading
should adhere to the timelines in academic calendar. The total number of contact hours for the
courses remains the same as that during the regular semesters, and therefore, the courses run
at accelerated pace (for example 6 hours of instructions per week is expected for a 3-0-0 course)
the Academic Calendar in this connection is strictly followed.
c) The dropping of a Summer Course is permitted within 7 days from the first lecture of the course.
Fee is not refundable.
d) Re-exam is permitted on the same terms and conditions like that of regular semester courses.
e) Time slots will be assigned by or communicated to the Academic Office like that of regular se-
mester courses.
f) A student can take up to a maximum of 24 credits of Mandatory Courses (Core + HSS + Depart-
ment & Institute Electives) in which s/he has received FR/DX/DR/W grade. However, if a student
accumulates two (or more) “FR” in Mandatory Courses and does not find enough courses
(totaling up to 24 credits) in a summer term, s/he can take a maximum of two
Mandatory Courses in which s/he has NEVER registered. (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective
from Summer term 2019-20).
g) Courses requiring pre-requisites need instructor’s approval in case the student has not
completed the pre-requisites. (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-
20).
h) NO restrictions (i.e. #f) will apply after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4
years for B.Tech, B.Des. and B.S., 5 years for DD). (Ref:239th Senate Meeting - effective from
Summer term 2019-20).
i) At least 05 students should register for the summer course. The attendance record
should be maintained and the minimum of 80% attendance is compulsory. The Instructors may
award a “FR” grade to students who fail to adhere to 80% attendance for the summer course.
j) Courses offered in a summer term will be treated as equivalent to regular semester courses for
all accounting purposes.
5. SPECIAL FEATURES IN REGISTRATION
The curriculum has special features that a student must be aware of while registering for courses. These
include institute core courses, department core and elective courses, non-departmental courses, minor
and honours options. Registration for courses depend on the academic standing of the student, as
18
Move to Index

--- Page 19 ---
explained in this section. The registration for backlog courses and audit courses are also explained in this
section.
5.1 Academic Standing (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting)
Depending on the overall academic performance of a student till date, especially in the two preceding
regular semesters (Autumn and Spring) in which the student had registered, the academic standing of
the student is decided. A NP (not passed) grade is not counted towards failed courses in the context of
determining the academic standing).
Categorization of the academic standing of a student is as follows:
Category I: A student who has CPI at least 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course.
Category II: CPI less than 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course.
Category III (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting): A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in
core courses and at most one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered
semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may
be earned in courses with any TAG.
Category IV (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting): A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in
core courses and more than one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered
semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may be
earned in courses with any TAG.
Category V: A student who has not earned at least 18 credits (in courses with any TAG) in at least one of
the previous two regular registered semesters.
Category VI (ARP): Students who have accumulated FRs/DXs worth 36 credits in core courses.
Note:
a) Category VI supersedes all other categories.
b) Students having at most 54 credits left to graduate may register for upto 54 credits on recom-
mendation of the Faculty Adviser/ PIC(ARP) (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting)
In such cases where students have returned from semester exchange and the grades are not updated till
the time of registration, the performance in the last two completed semesters at IIT Bombay may be
considered for the purpose of CPI and Academic Category calculation. The same rule is also applicable in
cases of semester drop. (Ref:237th Senate Meeting)
Interim Categories of the students are calculated using the information available 24 hours before regis-
tration for the new semester begins. These categories are used for the purpose of registration for the
new semester. (Ref:248th Senate Meeting)
5.2 Permissible Registration Load (Ref: 235th Senate meeting)
Students are allowed to register as per their academic standing subject to a maximum credit limit as
given below:
19
Move to Index

--- Page 20 ---
Academic Standing Maximum Credits Allowed
Category I 54 credits
Category II, III, IV 48 credits
Category V 30 credits
Category VI (ARP) 24 credits
The Faculty Adviser is the competent authority to approve course registration in all cases.
Every student must register for a minimum of 18 credits each semester. In case a student has completed
most of the minimum credit requirements, she/he may register for the remaining courses which are avail-
able in that semester, which may be less than 18 credits.
The maximum credits allowed as given above cannot be exceeded under any circumstances. While these
are the maximum allowed credits the Faculty Adviser may prescribe lower credits especially for Category
III, IV, V and VI.
The Dual Degree project credits will not be counted in case of permissible load. (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting)
The current limits on credits (as per the academic category) for registration purposes are applicable only
for students who have not yet completed the regular duration of programme for their degree, beyond
which the above restriction is waived. (w.e.f. Spring Semester 2020-21)
5.3 Carrying backlogs forward
Attempts are made in the programme to give an early opportunity to register again for courses in which
students may have received FR/ W/ DR/ DX grade.
a) The Institute core courses are expected to be offered in both the semesters, so that a student
can register for a backlog course in the immediate next semester.
b) For department core courses that are not possible to be offered in both semesters, the Faculty
Adviser may advise the students appropriately for dropping the backlog course in favor of some
other course in order to avoid a cascading effect in subsequent semesters. The Faculty Advisers
and DUGCs would exercise special care and assist the students in this regard.
c) Students should give priority to clear core courses that are pre-requisites for other courses in
subsequent semesters.
5.4 Audit Course
A student wanting just an exposure to a course, without the rigors of obtaining a letter grade, can register
a course in 'Audit' mode. A course can be audited provided the course is offered in the semester as a
credit course for others, and there is no slot clash. Prior permission of the Instructor is required.
To complete a course in 'Audit' mode, the student has to fulfil the requirement as set by the course
instructor, such as submission of assignments and minimum performances in in-semester evaluations. A
course, successfully completed in 'Audit' mode, cannot be considered towards the requirement of Minor
or Honours.
20
Move to Index

--- Page 21 ---
A student, on successful completion of the requirements of a course in 'Audit' mode, will be eligible for
a 'AU' grade. The 'AU' grade carries zero grade point and is not included in SPI/CPI calculations. The 'AU'
grade will be shown in the Transcript.
In case a student fails to complete the requirements of a course, registered in 'Audit' mode, instructor
will not assign any grade and the student will be de-registered from the course. The same will be deleted
from the student's registration, as it will be assumed that the course has been dropped by that student.
For the entire duration of the programme, a UG student can audit maximum TWO courses.
UG students, who are only in Category I and II, will be permitted to 'Audit' a course during a regular
semester.
5.5 Registration for Postgraduate level courses (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting)
Undergraduate students may be permitted to register for some postgraduate level courses from fifth
semester onwards with permission of the instructor and approval of the Faculty Adviser without any
restrictions.
5.6 Guided Study: (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)
Guided Study is doing courses outside the curriculum in the self-study like mode, during a regular semes-
ter. A student belonging to category I may be provided the option of Guided study to acquire proficiency
in an area of his/her choice, on recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ project guide, DUGC and ap-
proval of UGAPEC. Guided Study will be available to the extent of a maximum of one course per semester
with effect from the third semester, subject to a maximum of four courses in the entire programme. This
option is strictly subject to the availability and willingness of the instructor offering the course. Guided
Study and URA (refer Sec. 9) will not run concurrently, and the rules that govern permissible registration
load apply strictly even for these courses. These courses can be considered towards Minor/ Honours, if
so specified by the concerned academic unit. Registration, Examination/ Evaluation and submission of
grade etc. in case of guided study will also be governed in the similar way as other courses of the curric-
ulum.
The option of guided study may also be made available, by the UGAPEC, in the following situation, on a
case-by-case basis:
Students who miss the ‘Departmental Introductory Course’ due to a change of branch obtained at the
end of First year.
5.7 Self-Study (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting)
Students can take upto two courses as self-study, after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4
years for B.Tech, B.Des, B.S. Programs, 5 years for Dual Degree) after taking necessary approval. This
option is only available for completing the mandatory credits.
However, for the self-study option, the following directives will be followed: -
a) The registration, examination etc. will be as per academic calendar. The evaluation for self-study
will be done in the similar way as is done for normal semester course.
b) Academic standards be rigorously maintained in the self-study mode.
21
Move to Index

--- Page 22 ---
5.8 Course Substitution
In case a student obtains FR/DX grades or drops courses due to valid reason, s/he may like to sub-
stitute courses in order to complete the requirements within the stipulated duration. Following is the
guideline for course substitution.
a) Course substitution is not permitted for Core Courses, may it be an institute core course or de-
partmental core course. The student has to re-register the same course and complete them.
b) An Institute elective course may be substituted by another Institute elective course from the same
group.
c) A departmental elective course may be substituted by another departmental elective course from
the same group.
6 EXAMINATION / ASSESSMENT
Semester wise performance assessment of every registered student is done through various modes of
examinations. These include quizzes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva-voce, mid-
semester examination and semester-end examination. The Instructor will announce the modes of eval-
uation and distribution of weightage for each of the assessments at the beginning of the course.
Various modes of assessment for theory and laboratory courses along with the recommended relative
weightage of various components are given in this section. A large departure from the recommended
modes of assessments and weightage will require prior approval from the Dean of Academic Pro-
grammes.
6.1 Modes of Evaluation for Theory Courses
a) Various modes of assessment used for rating students’ performance in a theory course include quiz-
zes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva-voce, mid-semester and semester-end
examinations. Relative weightage for in-semester evaluations is typically between 50 and 60 per
cent. This will consist of one mid-semester exam of two hours duration, of about 25-30 per cent
weightage, to be held as per the schedule fixed in the Academic Calendar. Two quizzes or one quiz
and one test along with assignments and viva-voce shall make up the rest of the in-semester assess-
ment or as declared by the course instructor at the beginning of the semester The Instructor may
also set aside up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the in-semester marks for attendance and/or class
participation. (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting) Make-up for any absence from in-semester evaluations
like midsem/tests/quizzes will be at the discretion of the Instructor.
b) The semester end examination will be held as per the Academic Calendar and the weightage for
this would be typically 40 to 50 per cent. It is typically of 3 hours duration and covers the full syllabus
of the course. The semester- end examination is mandatory. The instructor awards an “II” grade for
those students not appearing for the Semester end examination, if they have not been awarded a
DX grade for insufficient attendance. Such students are eligible for a semester-end re-examination
only on medical grounds/ valid reasons (refer Sec. 6.6) and on production of medical certificate or
other supporting documents as the case requires. The application must be submitted to Instructor
concerned before the start date of re-exam and online grading window announced in the Academic
Calendar. Instructors are expected to conduct the re-exam and upload the grade as per academic
calendar.
22
Move to Index

--- Page 23 ---
c) If a student fails to appear for the re-examination too, the instructor will award “FR” grade again. If
the absence in the re exam is due to medical / valid reasons, the student must submit supporting
documents as mentioned above, within seven days of the scheduled date of the re-exam, to the
Academic Office. UGAPEC will examine such cases and convert the “II” grade into a dropped course
status (“DR”). In all other cases the “II” grade will be converted to “FR” grade. In any case the “II”
grade will not be continued beyond the commencement of the subsequent semester.
6.2 Modes of Evaluation for Laboratory Courses
The assessment in a laboratory course will be based on turn-to-turn supervision of the student’s work,
her/his performance in viva-voce examinations and group discussions, the quality of their work as pre-
scribed through laboratory journals and a semester-end test that contains an experiment or a written
examination. In-semester work will typically carry 75% and the semester-end test 25% weightage re-
spectively. It is obligatory to maintain a laboratory journal as prescribed by the course instructor. The
final examination for laboratory courses will typically be held a week before the final theory examina-
tions. In case of absence from semester-end examination, the same rules as those for theory courses is
applicable.
6.3 Modes of Evaluation for Seminars
Seminars are evaluated based on a written report and an oral presentation before a panel of examiners
appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator. The supervisor /co-supervisor, when involved, are part of the panel.
Grades carrying grade points are awarded as in the case of theory and laboratory courses based on the
quality of the report and performance in the presentation. The evaluation of the seminars is completed
and the grades submitted to the academic office (one week) before the commencement of the end-
semester examination.
6.4 Modes of Evaluation for Projects
As described in section 2, B.Tech project is not an Institute requirement. However, some departments
may make it as the department requirement for the degree, and some might make it only as a compo-
nent of the Honours requirement, whereas for Dual Degree, the project is a required component for the
award of degree. As the case may be, the separate modes of assessment are mentioned hereunder.
6.4.1 B.Tech. Project
B.Tech. Project may be offered as one unit as BTP, or two independent units as BTP - I and BTP - II.
Wherever it is split into two units, BTP - II builds on BTP - I, and BTP - I becomes a pre- requisite for BTP
– II. Departments may prescribe a minimum performance in BTP - I (which may be higher than the pass
grade ‘DD’) for being eligible for BTP - II. BTP - I and BTP - II are separately graded, at the end of the
respective semesters.
These projects are supervised, and need regular interaction (at least once a week) with the supervisor.
Student has to submit a project report and defend it in front of a panel of examiners. The dates for
submission of reports, the dates for presentations, and details of mode of assessment are decided by
the individual departments.
6.4.2 Dual Degree Projects
a) The following is the schedule for the DDP assessments:
23
Move to Index

--- Page 24 ---
I. For evaluation of DDP stage-I, the student has to submit a report to the respective depart-
ment. Evaluation will be done, by a panel appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator, based on the
report and (a) either an across the table discussion and viva-voce or (b) seminar presentation.
The panel shall consist of the supervisor(s) and atleast one more faculty member, to act as
examiners.
II. For evaluation of DDP stage-II, the student has to submit the reports to the respective de-
partments on or before one week from the date specified in the Academic Calendar. The
evaluation will be done by a Board of Examiners based on the report, and a viva-voce /
presentation. Final Grade reports are to be sent by the Department to the Academic Section
on completion of the viva-voce, as per the date specified in the Academic Calendar.
b) The Board of Examiners for DDP assessment is approved by the Convener, DUGC, and will consist
of the following: (Ref.: 159th & 191st Senate Meeting)
For DDP Stage I
I. Supervisor(s)
II. One Internal Examiner
For DDP Stage (Final) II
The Final (II) stage assessment will be done by a Board of Examiners appointed by the
DPGC/IDPC consisting of the following:
I. Supervisor (s)
II. Internal Examiner
III. External Examiner/Additional Internal Examiner in absence of External Examiner, if ap-
proved by the Academic Unit/Department
IV. Chairperson: A Professor/ Associate Professor from another academic unit or a different spe-
cialization/ research area. The Academic Unit may decide if a Chairperson is needed for the
viva or if one of the Internal Examiners can also act as a Chairperson. In case the Internal
Examiner happens to be a Professor/ Associate Professor, he may be designated to also serve
as the Chairperson with prior approval of the Convener, DPGC.
c) Submission of Electronic form of Dissertation/ Report (Ref: 204th Senate Meeting) Disserta-
tions/ Report needs to be submitted in electronic form to the Central Library. Due academic
approvals of the final version of the Dissertations/ Reports should be obtained from the super-
visor(s) prior to finalizing the archival version of the Dissertation/ Report. The student shall
submit the prescribed form for submission of dissertation/report to the academic unit/Aca-
demic Office, duly signed by the concerned, within ONE month, from the successful completion
of the defence. If the copies of dissertation submitted after the due date, a fine of Rs. 5000/-
per month from the due date of submission till the date of submission will be levied. (Amended
in the 207th Senate meeting). The final transcripts/provisional degree certificate/final degree
certificate will be issued only after receipt of dissertations/reports.
d) The minimum passing grade in each stage of the project assessment shall be “DD”.
24
Move to Index

--- Page 25 ---
e) After registering for DDP (either of the stages), a student should not take up any other assign-
ment (paid or unpaid) before submitting her/his dissertation.
f) After the Dissertation is assessed, a hard-bound copy of the final Dissertation along with duly
completed forms is to be submitted to the Academic office. Soft copies of the Synopsis and the
final Dissertation paper are to be submitted to the Central Library.
g) The project reports need to be submitted 7-15 days before the date of evaluation, but not earlier.
6.4.3 B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)
On completion of the project, student is required to submit a report and make a presentation to a com-
mittee appointed by the department which would award a letter grade.
6.4.4 Extension Rules for Projects (R&D, BTP, DDP, B.S. projects) (Ref. 236th Senate Meeting)
Grades for all registered project based courses have to be uploaded before the last date for grade sub-
mission. The evaluation committee may recommend an II grade for unfinished work due to any reason.
Also, if a grade is not uploaded by the academic unit by the last date for grade submission, an II grade
will be automatically assigned to the student.
In the case of R&D projects, BTP-1, BTP-2, DDP-1 and the first stage of the four year B.S. project and the
5 year integrated M.Sc project, a letter grade to replace the II grade must be submitted to the academic
office, at most 20 days after the last date for grade submission of the previous semester. If a letter grade
is not received by the academic office in time, the II grade will be automatically converted to an FR. No
further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects. The student may re-register for
the project (mandatory for DDP-1) in a subsequent semester in case an FR grade is assigned.
For the final stage of the B.S./M.Sc project and DDP-2, a letter grade to replace the ‘II’ grade must be
submitted to the academic office at most 20 days after the last date for the grade submission. However,
the student may apply for an additional extension of at most 15 days (a final deadline of 35 days from
the last date for grade submission of the previous semester), with recommendations and an explanation
for the delay by the guide, to the DUGC of the concerned academic unit. Post assessment, the grade
may then be sent to the academic office through the Convener, DUGC before this date. After this date
(35 days from the last date for grade submission for project) the II grade will be automatically converted
to an FR grade. The student will then have to re-register for the course in the subsequent semester after
payment of fees. No further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects.
The decision on allotment of hostel rooms during such extensions is done independently by the Dean
(Student Affairs)/ Hostel Co-ordination Unit.
6.5 Grading
a) Indian Institute of Technology Bombay follows grading system. Based on the combined perfor-
mance in all assessments, the student is awarded a letter grade in every course taken by him/her
in a particular semester as per the curriculum. These letter grades not only indicate a qualitative
assessment of the student’s performance but also carry a quantitative (numeric) equivalent
called the Grade Point. The letter grades and their equivalent grade point are given below:
Letter Grade Point

AP 10 (Grade is awarded to students with exceptional performance)
AA 10
AB 9
BB 8
BC 7
CC 6
CD 5
DD 4
0 {Fail and repeat the course/ equivalent course for mandatory courses
FR
(except core)}
FF 0 (Fail & Re-examination)
{Credits are not included in CPI. Attendance below 80% - Repeat the
DX course for core course(s)/equivalent course for mandatory courses (ex-
cept core)}
W Course Withdrawn
AU Satisfactory in an Audit course
PP Passed
NP Not Passed
Incomplete (place holder, gets converted to an appropriate grade after
II
Semester end re-examination, as per applicability)
Dropped (DR is not a grade but only a position holder indicating that
DR the course has been dropped and it has to be cleared in subsequent
semesters).
A student passes the course if he/she gets any grade in the range of “AP” to “DD” (“AU” in the case of
an audit course, but fails if he/she gets the grade “FR” and/or “DX”. ”FF”, “II” and “DR” are place holders.
b) The grade “AP” indicates exceptional performance and is awarded only in the Course/(s) in
which the number of registered students is more than 50. It should not exceed 2 % of the total
strength of the particular theory or lab course. The grade “AP” is not awarded for projects /
seminars.
c) An “FR” grade is awarded in case/(s) where, in the opinion of the instructor (panel of examiners
in the case of projects), the performance of the student is below an acceptable threshold in the
in-semester and /or end-semester examinations. It may also be awarded for Academic malprac-
tices. Details pertaining to Academic malpractices are available at:
http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July.pdf
d) (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting) ‘DX’ grade is awarded to students who have inadequate attendance
as per following:
26
Move to Index

--- Page 27 ---
IIT Bombay expects one hundred percent (100 %) from its students in all classes. If the at-
tendance of the student, as counted with effect from the first contact hour, falls below eighty
percent of the total attendance expected, the instructor may award the student, ‘Drop due to
inadequate attendance’, ‘DX’ grade in that course. This ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance’
Grade would, for the purpose of CPI calculation be treated as equivalent to a ‘Course Drop’ car-
ried out on initiation by the student. In calculating attendance, no specific concession is to be
given for lack of attendance on Medical ground. Further, if a student has 80% attendance or
more, he/ she cannot be awarded ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance. Only exception to this
rule is courses where the instructor has declared a prior in the first week that no DX grade will
be awarded.
e) For a student present in the semester-end re-examination, the instructor will award a regular
performance grade (AP-FR) depending on the overall performance in the course including the
re-examination.
f) There are, however, a few other academic requirements for the programmes. The following two
grades viz., “PP” (Pass) and “NP” (Not pass), will be awarded for NCC/NSO/NSS. No grade points
are associated with these grades and performance in these courses is not taken into account in
the calculation of the performance indices (SPI, CPI). However, the award of the degree is sub-
ject to obtaining a “PP” (Pass) grade in all such courses. A student will be awarded “PP” (Pass) /
“NP” (Not Pass) grade for NCC/ NSO/NSS in each semester provided the minimum requirement
of these activities are met during that semester together with 80% minimum attendance, failing
which the “NP” (Not Pass) grade will be awarded.
g) (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting- effective from End Semester Examinations of the Spring Semester
2019-20).
“FF” grade can be awarded to UG students by the concerned course instructor. The students
will be given only one chance for re-examination in case of FF grade, otherwise the
grade will be converted to FR. Re-exam will be conducted for 50 % weightage (or same as the
weightage of end-semester exam for the course). Re-exam for students with FF grade will be
conducted along with medical re-exam.
The grade will be restricted to “DD” for the re-examination, in case of FF Grade.
h) Course(s) completed by student(s) outside IIT Bombay by means of NPTEL and / or SWAYAM
and / or Semester Exchange, following due approval of DUGC/ DPGC, will contribute only to-
wards completion of credits. Grade(s) earned in such courses will not be considered for the SPI/
CPI calculation. The transcript will record such course(s) and the corresponding grade(s) as it is/
they are. (Applicable for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses from the academic year 2020-2021 onwards
and for Semester exchange students for academic year 2021-22 onwards.) (Ref: 246th Senate
Meeting)
6.6 Valid reasons for semester-end make-up examination (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)
Following may be considered as valid reasons for semester – end make-up examination:
a) Serious illness/ accident in the case of the student herself/ himself. Serious illness/ accident/
death of parent/ guardian.

6.7 Academic Malpractice
Academic malpractices are severely dealt with. The details pertaining to Academic malpractices are avail-
able at: http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July.pdf
6.8 Semester Performance Index/ Cumulative Performance Index (SPI/CPI)
6.8.1 Semester Performance Index (SPI)
The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called Semester Performance Index,
SPI. The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by the
student during the semester. For example, if a student passes five courses (Theory/labs. /Projects/ Sem-
inar etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and her/his grade points in these courses are
g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5 respectively, then her/his SPI is equal to:
C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5
SPI = ----------------------------------------------------------
C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5
The SPI is calculated to two decimal places. The SPI for any semester will take into consideration the FR
grades awarded in that semester. For example, if a student has failed in course 4, the SPI will then be
computed as:
C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5
SPI = -------------------------------------------------------------------
C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5
The courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for
calculation of the SPI. Such additional courses undertaken and the grades earned by the student will be
shown separately.
The updated SPIs will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course +
project) as per the Academic Calendar. Till then, only the SPI till previous completed semesters will be
displayed.
6.8.2 Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)
An up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the Insti-
tute is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a manner
similar to the calculation of SPI. The CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by the student,
towards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he entered the Institute.
The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places.
The CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared.
When the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI will
only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier.
Example: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a “FR” grade in
course i. The semester grade report at the end of semester r therefore will contain a CPI calculated as:
28
Move to Index

--- Page 29 ---
C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci* ZERO+Cn gn
CPI = -------------------------------------------------------------------------
C1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn
Even if a student has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the numerator
as well as the denominator.
At the end of semester r+1 s/he has registered for four more courses including the backlog course i and
has cleared all the courses including the backlog course, the CPI at the end of this semester is calculated
as:
C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci*gi+..+Cn gn
CPI = --------------------------------------------------------------------
C1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn
The courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for
calculation of the basic CPI. These courses will be shown separately.
The updated CPI will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course +
project) as per the Academic Calendar. Till then, only the CPI till previous completed semesters will be
displayed.
The Transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e. a) CPI Courses and b) CPI – Courses +Project. (Ref: 241st Sen-
ate Meeting)
6.8.3 Semester Grade Report
The Senate of IIT Bombay in its 221st Meeting considered discontinuation of issue of Semester Grade
Cards from Spring Semester 2014-15.
All students are able to see their grades as soon as concerned Course instructor /Faculty member uploads
grades on the ASC. Students may use the data from their interface for the purpose of information and
conveying to their parents as well.
6.8.4 The Transcript: Consolidated Statement of Academic Performance
Transcript is a consolidated statement of a Academic Performance of a student for all the semesters
since joining the programme and is given to a student on successful completion of the programme along
with the degree certificate. For those students who have taken multiple attempts to clear a course, the
transcript given on successful completion of the programme will record the entire history of the aca-
demic performance of a student in all the courses he/she takes as a student in the Institute. Therefore
every course registered by a student and the grades obtained there upon (including FR,DX,W etc.) will
be mentioned in the transcript for the courses registered in the Autumn Semester 2016-17 onwards.
(Ref: 225th Senate Meeting). The transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e. a) CPI Courses and b) CPI- Courses
+ Project. (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) Additional courses will be shown separately, indicating also the
minor / Honours, if any, earned by the student. Additional copies of the transcript can be obtained if
needed, on request and upon payment of applicable fee.
Students who have not yet completed the programme can obtain an Interim Transcript, if needed, on
request and upon payment of applicable fee.

6.9 Display of In-Semester Performance
a) The in-semester performance of all students is communicated by the instructor to the students
before the end-semester examination. Those awarded “DX” grades as described in 6.5 (d) above
will be clearly identified in this list.
b) Based on the in-semester performance, the instructor may also decide and publish a cut-off
(based on the average performance of the class), below which the in-semester performance is
considered ‘Unsatisfactory’. This will be the basis on which an instructor may declare a “FR”
grade even when a student is absent for the end-semester examination on valid grounds.
6. 10 Disclosing evaluated material in a course
A course instructor will make arrangements for students to see all evaluated answer scripts, student
submissions and other graded material before finalization of grades for theory as well as for lab courses
as per dates published in Academic calendar.
6.11 Answer Script Retention period
Evaluated answer scripts are preserved by the Instructor/ Departmental Office for one semester.
6.12 Compensatory time to PwD students (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting- effective from End Semester
examination of the Autumn Semester 2019-20)
Compensatory time is to be provided to all PwD students across the Institute during written examination.
For PwD Students, ‘compensatory time’ will not be less than 20 minutes per hour of examination for
persons who are allowed use of scribe/ reader/ lab assistant. All the candidates with
benchmark disability not availing the facility of scribe may be allowed additional time of
minimum of one hour for examination of 3 hours duration. In case the duration of the
examination is less than an hour, then the duration of additional time will be allowed on pro rata basis.
Additional time will not be less than 5 minutes and will be in the multiple of 5”.
PwD students must inform the instructors in advance regarding their need for compensatory time during
examination.
7. Registration of NPTEL/ SWAYAM Courses:
a) A student can take maximum of 12 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of departmental
elective and Institute elective courses for the regular student (not under ARP), and, (b) a maxi-
mum of 24 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of any courses including core courses for
the students, who are under ARP or in extension years after the approval from DUGC of the
parent department towards the partial completion of mandatory academic curriculum.
b) A student can take NPTEL/SWAYAM courses as 'Additional Learning' for UG students subject to
not exceeding credit limit based on approval of DUGC. (Ref: 243rd Senate Meeting)
7.1 Credit Equivalence of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses with IIT Bombay courses (249th Senate Meet-
ing):
a) 12 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be typically considered equivalent to 6 credits at IIT
Bombay. However, in some special cases, DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC may consider and approve 12
weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM course(s) equivalent to 8 credits at IIT Bombay.
30
Move to Index

--- Page 31 ---
b) 8 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be considered equivalent to 4 or 3 credits at IIT Bom-
bay, depending on approval of DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC.
7.2 Policy for registering/ award of grades for NPTEL/ SWAYAM/ Semester Exchange courses (Ref.
251st Senate)
a) Registration for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses: Students may register for these courses during regis-
tration window as per Academic calendar for that semester. Faculty Advisor can approve these
registrations in consultation with DUGC.
b) Registration for Semester Exchange Courses: Academic Units may register students for these
courses as and when student returns from the FRN Institute, as per approval of DUGC.
c) Grading- As per Academic calendar for that semester along with other courses.
d) If no grades are allotted during the approved window, the course will be removed automatically
from the registration of the students on the last date of Academic Activity, so that there will be
no issue in calculating SPI/CPI of the student.
8 CHANGE OF BRANCH
The Senate in its 256th meeting has approved the elimination of Branch Change into any of the JOSAA
administered branches of admission. This is applicable for the students admitted through JEE (Advanced)
2023 onwards.
However, in 257th meeting of the Senate, it was approved that branch change option be made available
to the preparatory students of 2022 batch who upon passing preparatory course will join IIT Bombay in
July/ August 2023 by considering the following:
a) Their branch change option will be exercised in 2024 after completion of the prescribed course
credits in the first two semesters.
b) No FR/DX/DR/W grades at the end of the first two regular registered semesters.
c) NP grade in NOCS shall not be a bar for applying for a branch change.
d) NP grade in GC 101 shall not be a bar for applying for a branch change.
e) The closing CPI (branch change CPI) of each programme/ department of UG 2022 entrants- will be
considered as cut-off CPI for preparatory students of 2022 batch for their respective pro-gram/de-
partment.
f) Their branch change CPI will be executed based on their overall CPI.
g) These students can apply for the programmes/ departments for a branch change which are availa-
ble for UG 2023 batch admitted through JEE (Adv.).
h) Supernumerary seats will be created in these programme/ department if needed.
Important: The above branch change provision is only available for the preparatory students of 2022
batch who have been entered in IIT Bombay in 2023 after successfully completing preparatory course.

9 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
9.1 Award of Degree
On successful completion of the prescribed requirements for a programme {B.Tech.; B.S.; Dual Degree
(B.Tech. and M.Tech.)}, degree will be conferred on a student in an annual convocation of the Institute.
The degree certificate will indicate the relevant branch, and specializations if any, in the engineering or
science discipline in which the student has graduated. For example: Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engi-
neering, Master of Science in Chemistry, or Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering and Master
of Technology in Electrical Engineering with Specialization in Microelectronics.
In those cases where the student has earned the required credits for an Honours in her/his discipline or
a Minor in another discipline within the stipulated time, this will be mentioned in the degree certificate:
for example:
a) B.Tech. in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science with Minor in Environmental Sciences
and Engineering.
b) B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering with Honours.
c) B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering with Honours and Minor in Electrical Engineering.
d) B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering.
For Dual Degree students
a) B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering and M.Tech. in Chemical Engineering with Specialization (if any).
b) B.Tech. In Chemical Engineering with Minor in Electrical Engineering and M.Tech. In Chemical En-
gineering with Specialization (if any).
Along with the degree certificate, the student will be given a complimentary copy of transcript, giving
semester-wise details of all academic accomplishments. The additional courses taken, whether earning
a minor/ Honours or not, will be separately mentioned in the transcript. If an Honours/ minor is earned
that will also be mentioned. An overall CPI for all the academic work done by the student will be given.
The transcript and the final degree certificate will not mention any class whatsoever; only the CPI/s will
be given in the transcript. Honours is not indicative of class.
For conferment of degree, student has to fulfill the following requirements:
a) The student should have taken and passed all the courses prescribed for the degree under the gen-
eral institutional and departmental requirements.
b) The student should have satisfactorily fulfilled other academic requirements such as practical train-
ing, NSS/NSO/NCC, work visits, seminar and projects, as specified for the discipline/programme.
c) The student should have paid all the Institute dues.
d) The student should have no case of indiscipline pending against him/her.
9.2 Award of Medals
The rules and procedures for the Institute Medals including Department silver medals, PGM (President
of India Medal) and Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma Gold Medal. (Ref: 229th Senate Meeting)- to be implemented
for award of Medal from 55th Convocation.
32
Move to Index

--- Page 33 ---
a) Eligibility for award of PGM, IGM and ISM (for UG), shall be highest CPI based on the mandatory
courses for B.Tech./B.S. with Honours.
b) For DD (B.Tech.+M.Tech.), the students of a particular Department shall be competing with the
students of 4 year B.Tech. of their Department admitted together. And therefore, their CPI at
the end of 4th year shall be taken into consideration.
c) Tie breaking rule shall be as follows:
I. In case of tie in CPI for the President of India Medal (PGM) & Institute Gold Medal (IGM),
the CPI across all courses taken (including additional and minor courses) up to end of 4th
year will be used to break the tie.
II. In case of tie in the CPI for award of Silver Medals equal number of medals will be given.
Guidelines for award of Institute Medals: (Ref: 234th Senate Meeting)
A student will be considered for the medals, if the student has obtained overall CPI 9.0 or above (includ-
ing MTPs). The grade of “II” on medical ground and/or “W” in a course shall not be the bar.
Following shall be considered a disqualification for award of Medals:
a) The award of “DX” or “FF”or “FR” grade(s) in a course (of any tag ie. Core, Elective, Additional
Learning, etc.)
b) Extension for final stage MTPs.
c) Any punishment under DAC/ADAC during the programme. (The names of the proposed medalist
be verified from the Dean (Student Affairs) office for any DAC punishment)
d) A semester drop.
NPTEL/ SWAYAM and or Semester exchange course(s).
a) The students taking up courses outside IIT Bombay by means of NPTEL/ SWAYAM and or Semeter
exchange shall be eligible for the award of Medals and Prizes. (Ref: 246th Senate Meeting)
9.3 Transfer to Academic Rehabilitation Programme (ARP): (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)
Given that some of the best talents in the country take admission at this Institute, it is expected that all
of them perform very well, and fully utilize the various opportunities provided for their academic ad-
vancement. However, in a few cases, students are unable to cope with the studies here. This may often
be due to a lack of aptitude or a mismatch between the student’s interest and what the programmes
provide. Early recognition of this tendency permits corrective action to be taken in time, and the students
to pursue their careers elsewhere. The students with poor Academic performance are transferred to the
Academic Rehabilitation programme (ARP) (Ref. Sec 10)
I.4 Exit Degree option for Undergraduates (Ref: 253rd Senate Meeting)
I) Eligibility Criteria:
1. The students admitted and registered in the regular undergraduate programme, viz. B.Tech.,
B.S., B.Des., B.Tech.+M.Tech. (DD) shall be eligible for an exit degree, if they fulfill the follow-
ing criteria:
33
Move to Index

--- Page 34 ---
(A) Minimum 160 credits to be completed as detailed below:
(i) ES 200 and HS 200 (3+3 = 6 Credits); AND
(ii) Minimum Dept. credits = 60 for specialization. OR
(iii) Minimum Science and Engg. credits = 60 without specialization.
(B) Minimum duration of B.Sc. (Engineering) and related exit degrees will be 6 semesters.
Students can apply for an exit degree after 4th semester.
(C) The specialization can only be in the dept. they are registered in at the time of appli-
cation.
2. The exit degree option is also available to all students who were admitted to the UG Pro-
grammes, who have not completed their degree requirements within the stipulated time and
have not been terminated.
II) Process to apply:
1. A student can apply for the Exit Degree through prescribed application form (Annexure I)
and submit to the Faculty Advisor.
2. Faculty Advisor may recommend the application to the DUGC.
3. DUGC may recommend the application to the UGAPEC Convener.
4. UGAPEC Convener may approve the application.
III) Degree Nomenclature:
1. Exit from B.Tech./Dual Degree (B.Tech. + M.Tech.) is mapped to B.Sc.(Engg.)
A. Example: in case of B.Sc.(Engg.) without specialization
“Bachelor of Science (3-year) in Engineering”
B. Example: in case of B.Sc.(Engg.) with specialization in Electrical Engineering
“Bachelor of Science (3-year) in Electrical Engineering”
2. Exit from B.S. in Chemistry and B.S. in Mathematics is mapped to B.Sc. (3 years)
“Bachelor of Science (3-year) in Chemistry”
or
“Bachelor of Science (3-year) in Mathematics”
3. Exit from B.S. in Economics is mapped to B.A. (3 years)
“Bachelor of Arts (3-year) in Economics”
4. Exit from B.Des. is mapped to B.Des. (3 years)
“Bachelor of Design (3-year)”
34
Move to Index

--- Page 35 ---
IV) Important Notes:
1. The date and month of passing would be the approval of exit degree by the UGAPEC
Convener.
2. The students having the exit degree as their last qualification, will not be eligible for apply-
ing for M.Tech./ M.Des. Programme in IITB.
3. In case of lapsed registration, students may apply to regularize their semester registrations
through DUGC and complete pending credits required for the exit degree.
4. The students are required to pay the continuation fees for the dropped semester(s), if any
and clear all pending fees/ dues/ DAC punishments (as applicable).
9.5 Early exit for poorly performing Dual Degree Students
Early exits for poorly performing Dual Degree students is permitted after the ninth semester, if the CPI
upto that point is below 5.00. A few students in the Dual Degree Programmes indicate inability/ disincli-
nation to complete the Dual Degree Programme for various reasons and seek an exit with only a B.Tech.
Degree. This is also what the supervisors/ faculty advisers recommend based on their observation of the
student.
If a given department/ academic unit, through deliberation in the DUGC, finds that a particular student,
irrespective of academic performance, is unlikely to complete the requirements of the Dual Degree (B.
Tech. + M. Tech.) satisfactorily then it may recommend to the UGAPEC that the student be permitted to
exit with only the B. Tech. Degree but with the following mandatory clauses:
a) The academic requirements of the B. Tech. Degree must be completed.
b) The student shall exit only after the ninth semester of the programme meaning that there is at
least one semester of time penalty imposed for this exit. (this penalty is applicable even to date).
c) The student shall be awarded only the B. Tech. Degree and not Honours or Minor(s).
d) The transcript given to the student along with the degree would mention that the student had
been admitted to the Dual Degree Programme, but was awarded a B. Tech. Degree as an exit
option, due to inability to complete the Dual Degree Programme. The degree would not mention
anything of the kind.
10 UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AWARDS (URA)
Some students may have an inclination towards research. The Undergraduate Research Awards (URA) is
designed for such students. URA will be available at three levels, all of them independent of each other.
They will carry codes similar to course codes so that they can be listed in grade reports.
URA01: for preliminary research/ developmental experience
URA02: for B. Tech. Level Research Project.
URA03: for Dual Degree Level Research Project
URA01: This is a recognition of a small research/ developmental effort, successfully completed by a stu-
dent in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate programme – that is, a B.Tech., B.S. or a Dual
Degree Programme. A faculty member must agree to supervise the student for the URA01 project. The
student works with this faculty member, with the approval of the DUGC, for four-to-six month duration
– including the summer or winter vacations. No formal registration is required with the academic office
35
Move to Index

--- Page 36 ---
at this stage. If the faculty member is satisfied with the quantum and quality of work done, at any stage,
s/he may recommend the award of URA01 to the student, which will then be listed in the transcript of
the student in the semester immediately following the semester in which this award was recommended.
No credits are assigned to URA01. URA01 can be awarded only once to a student. The grade for URA01
will be “PP”.
URA02: This is to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent, done
in the B.Tech. Project. If the committee evaluating the B.Tech. Project of a B.Tech. student believes that
the student has carried out truly exceptional work in the B.Tech. Project and the quantum of work is
substantially higher than what is expected, it may recommend that two more faculty members, other
than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by the DUGC, examine
the work done and evaluate whether a URA02 can be awarded to the student in addition to the AA grade
already given. A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of evaluation
and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA02, duly routed through the
Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned
on the grade report of the student as URA02 carrying six credits and the grade AA. No formal registration
is required with the academic office. The advantage to the student would be that his / her CPI would
improve, given that these credits are with an AA grade. URA 2 is not available for DD students. Students
should have earned minimum of 12 credits in BTP, in order to apply for URA 02 (Ref: 241st Senate
Meeting)
URA03: These are to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent,
in the Dual Degree Project. If the committee evaluating the Final Stage of the Dual Degree Project of a
given Dual Degree student believes that the student has carried out truly exceptional work and the quan-
tum of work is substantially higher than what is expected, it may recommend that two more faculty
members, other than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by
the DUGC, examine the work done and evaluate whether a URA03 can be awarded to the student in
addition to the AA grade already given. A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original
committee of evaluation and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA03,
duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the
UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA03 carrying six credits and the
grade AA. No formal registration is required with the academic office. The advantage to the student
would be that his / her CPI would improve, given that these credits are with an AA grade.
11. ACADEMIC REHABILITATION PROGRAMME (ARP)
The Academic Rehabilitation Program (ARP) deals with students with poor performance in academics. It
acts as a buffer for such students and provides them with an opportunity to continue in the institute and
successfully complete their respective degrees. A student is transferred to ARP on receiving FR/DX grades
for at least 36 credits in core courses. A faculty member in each department, called the ARP Faculty
Adviser, will assist students of that department to register for courses manually, for a maximum of 24
credits.
A student, who is able to reduce the total number of FR/DX credits to less than 36 as above is transferred
back to being a regular student. On failure to exit the ARP after three consecutive semesters in the pro-
gram, termination of registration from the program may be recommended.
